'''
Create objects that act as both context managers *and* as decorators, and behave
the same in both cases.

Context managers inheriting from ``ContextDecorator`` have to implement 
``__enter__`` and ``__exit__`` as normal. ``__exit__`` retains its optional
exception handling even when used as a decorator.

Example::

   from contextlib import ContextDecorator

   class mycontext(ContextDecorator):
      def __enter__(self):
         print 'Starting'
         return self

      def __exit__(self, *exc):
         print 'Finishing'
         return False

   @mycontext()
   def function():
      print 'The bit in the middle'
   
   with mycontext():
      print 'The bit in the middle'

Existing context managers that already have a base class can be extended by
using ``ContextDecorator`` as a mixin class::

   from contextlib import ContextDecorator

   class mycontext(ContextBaseClass, ContextDecorator):
      def __enter__(self):
         return self

      def __exit__(self, *exc):
         return False
